# Doge Cafe

A project made with (/by) Jordan Picton. Jordan is a fledgling software developer looking to improve his skills. I'm reviewing his code and helping him create a basic website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is currently in development with periodic tasks, such as setting up a navbar with dropdown elements, creating content sections, etc, with a fun 'dog' theme.
